# MVSIB
This paper introduces a unified MVC model (MVSIB). The model adaptively differentiates false negatives from hard negatives through uncertainty measurement and curriculum learning, while enhancing feature discrimination with a combination of soft masking and adversarial loss. We will upload the complete code files once the paper is accepted by the journal.
